The standard does not clearly define TypeA and TypeC for the\nea1ChsPlain and the ea1ChtPlain values of the ST_TextAutonumberScheme simple\ntype.  In Office, TypeA: The Chinese character \u201c\u5341\u201d\nis used to represent 10. For example, 20 is represented as \u4e8c\u5341 and\n99 is represented as \u4e5d\u5341\u4e5d.  TypeC: each digit is written out separately and zero\nis represented by the ideographic Chinese character \"\u3007\". For\nexample, 20 is represented as \u4e8c\u3007, 99 is represented as\n\u4e5d\u4e5d and 102 is represented as \u4e00\u3007\u4e8c.

configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution. Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility  Reg  may be used for local or remote Registry modification.  [1]  Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API. Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via  Reg  or other utilities using the Win32 API.  [2]  Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.  [3]  [4] The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system.  [5]  Often  Valid Accounts  are required, along with access to the remote system's  SMB/Windows Admin Shares  for RPC communication.
